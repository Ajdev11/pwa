    content: `<p>When kids learn about different Sustainable Development Goals and how they are interrelated, they develop a better understanding of the world. Learning about global challenges our community faces such as poverty, inequality and climate change, they become more aware of what’s happening around the world and develop empathy and compassion. For example, learning about Goal 10 (reducing inequality) will help children understand the importance of respecting people regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, background and other characteristics.</p>
    <p>Children form core values, attitudes and habits at an early age and these values can persist for a long time. When we teach children about Sustainable Development Goals such as gender equality, quality education and responsible consumption, they grow up conscious and ready to contribute to achieving SDGs by 2030.</p>
    <p>Child participation is one of the guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They have the right to participate in all matters affecting them within their communities, families, and schools. When children learn about the SDGs, they also learn about different actions they can take in everyday life in order to contribute to achieving those goals. This will help them feel motivated and encourage their meaningful participation in society. Children will feel inspired to create a better future for the world. In addition, community engagement will give children a sense of belonging which is crucial to the building of their identity.</p>
    <p>If we want our nations and communities to grow and prosper, then we all will have to bet on children and youth and their contribution. The aim of Educacion Diversa is to provide art-based educational materials for children to learn about SDGs. With our educational materials on SDGs, they will be able to learn in a playful and engaging way. We hope this will inspire them to become global leaders and vote every day about the kind of world they want to live in. </p>`,

    content: `<p>In 1993, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly defined violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women” (United Nations, 1993). In real terms this includes violence in domestic and inter-personal relationships; many forms of sexual violence including rape and sexual assault; systemic, institutional and culture based forms of violence; and new emerging forms of harassment and stalking based in modern technology. </p>
    <p>In this context, experience has demonstrated that women are significantly more likely to experience GBV than men. It has also shown that working with men, as partners, is critical to the prevention of and response to GBV. </p>
    <p>But why is important to work with men to address GBV? Work with men and boys can have a positive, transformative impact for the lives of women and girls, but also for the lives of men and boys. There is a much broader spectrum of positive roles for men and boys to play than perpetrator or potential perpetrator of gender-based violence. These roles not only prevent and reduce violence against women, but also improve the lives of men and boys by freeing them from these harmful and limiting aspects of masculinities. As a result, we can eliminate gender inequalities that hold back the development of our communities and nation, and ensure that women and girls that men care about do not have to live a life in fear of violence.</p>
    <p>And what are some benefits for men of getting engage in elimination of GBV? Better relationships, better health; Not being lumped into a stereotypical group of "men", not having to conform to negative aspects of masculinity; More freedom to pursue any activities in which they are interested; People men care about (mothers, sisters, girlfriends, aunts, etc) have a lesser chance of being harmed by violence and other gender inequities; Not bullied by other men for stepping outside the gender “box”; Less pressure to be the sole provider and protector, more economic prosperity for all. </p>
    <p>Achieving gender equality is a societal responsibility that must fully engage both men and women. Men need to be addressed as part of the solution, not just part of the problem. They need to be invited and challenged to critically reflect on the existence of patriarchy, male power and privilege; to analyze the costs to women and girls, but also the costs to men and boys. Finally, men and boys also need to be shown the benefits of gender equality, to women, girls, and all of humanity.</p>`,

    title: "How to talk to kids about body safety and consent",
    excerpt: "Moreover, many parents  and caregivers often wait until their children are older to talk about sexual consent. What they are missing on is the fact that sexual consent is not just in relation to intercourse. Waiting until your child is ready to become sexually active...",
    slug: "How-to-talk-to-kids-about-body-safety-and-consent",
    image: "/images/static/examples/blogs/blogpost3.jpg",
    content: `<p>“How about a hug?” a relative asked my daughter the other day, her negative response at first was shutdown, “Come on, it’s only a hug and I miss you”.</p>
    <p>This is when I said, “It’s ok, you can go and play, and if you want to come back and give a hug, you can. But you don’t have to.”</p>
    <p>You see, what kind of messages are we giving our children when we are telling them that they have to say Yes and give consent to physical touch when it comes to certain people, because they are relatives, or friends, or it’s socially not ok to turn them down, when at the same time we are telling them that they have the power to say NO?</p>
    <p>Moreover, many parents  and caregivers often wait until their children are older to talk about sexual consent. What they are missing on is the fact that sexual consent is not just in relation to intercourse. Waiting until your child is ready to become sexually active before you start talking about consent, may place your child in vulnerable situation in relation to any unwanted physical touch.</p>
    <p>One in four girls and one in 20 boys are sexually abused before the age of 18, and about 35 percent of sexual abuse victims are under 12 years old—elementary school age. And in a 2018 national survey, over 80 percent of women and 40 percent of men reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment or assault in their lifetime. </p>
    <p>This said, sitting down a toddler to explain to them what sexual abuse is, will most probably just confuse and scare them. 
      So how and when to talk about keeping safe? I truly believe we need to teach safe, protective education and consent from the age of 3, using really clear, simple messages that do not aim to scare those children.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Start with using correct words for all body parts. 
    </li>
    <p>This should happen actually from day 1, as we are changing nappies for the infant, we start by mentioning that we are now cleaning the penis, the vulva, and the bottom. Those are body parts just like the nose, knees, or hands. Those parts are not unacceptable, taboos or have purely sexual connotations, it’s our perception of them that makes them as such.</p>
    <p>The reason why this is important, is that research has shown that children who are confident in using the proper names of those body parts are much more likely to tell if something inappropriate happens.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it shows sexual predators that the child and his parents talk about this at home and hence adds another obstacle to the abuse.</p>
    <li>Introduce the concept of consent.</li>
    <p>Kids need to feel fully in control of their bodies and hence it is important to make it a habbit to ask your children if you can touch them, even for a cuddle or a hug. We explain to our 2-3 year old that I need to touch their private part to clean after they have done a poo if they have not mastered that yet or they are still in their nappy.
      We also repeat that they have the power to say NO and everyone regardless of who they are, have to respect our NO and we in turn have to accept and respect the NO coming from others.</p>
    <p>This leads us to point number 3.</p>
    <li>Don’t force hugs and kisses.</li>
    <p>We can’t emphasise how important it is to keep reminding children that they are the bosses of their own body. </p>
    <p>Stating that to them is not enough though.</p>
    <p>What kind of a message are we sending when we are telling them: “ you are the boss of your body” and then only 5-10 mins later to say “It’s not nice to say No to grandma, go give her a hug, she loves you”.</p>
    <p>Yes you guessed it, we are telling them that they are not really the boss of thei own bodies, because, Grandam and Grandpa and Uncle and Auntie and Grandma’s friend and our Neighbour X are allowed to give you hugs and kisses and make you feel uncomfortable even if you say NO!!!</p>
    <p>Hence, that molester who happens to also be someone I know (because 93% of the time they are) can touch me because they also love me? And it’s not ok to say no to someone I know who is showing me “affection”?</p>
    <p>You see where I am going with this?</p>
    <li>Teach kids to understand and trust their feelings</li>
    <p>Start by teaching children to identify and name their feelings and those of others. Whether through role plays, a fun memory matching game or sitting with them and talking about how they felt around a certain situation (whether happy or not).</p>
    <p>Let them identify where that feeling also was in their body, when I felt scared from the sound of the balloon popping my heart ached. Explain to them that if they ever feel uncomfortable, anxious, scared, etc because of someone or what they may have said or done, they need to come to you directly and that YOU WILL TRUST THEIR FEELINGS TOO no matter who that other person is.</p>
    <li>Teach them Safe VS Unsafe touches</li>
    <p>While you may be familiar with the “bad touch”, “good touch” concept, I personally along with others prefer not to use it as the word bad by itself (bad feeling, bad behaviour, bad person) has a deep routed meaning of shame and guilt.
      This may demotivate the child to tell so he won’t be associated with these two words. 
      Furthermore, this may cause confusion as not all perpetrators are violent or aggressive with their victims. Some are gentle which may cause an unwanted and rather instinctual “good feeling” for the child leading them to again wonder why is this “bad”? and should I feel ashamed that it did not feel “bad” for me?</p>
    <p>Hence, using terms such as safe and unsafe touches are easier for a child to understand and does not include a lot of misinterpretation. Just like it’s Unsafe to cross the traffic light when it is red, it’s unsafe for anyone to touch you on your private parts which include the: Penis, Scrotum, Vulva, Bottom, Chest, Breast, and Mouth, unless it’s the doctor in the presence and consent of your parents, your parents/carer if they are cleaning that area after a poo (up to a certain age…when they can be doing that independently).</p>
    <li>Teach your child Safe VS Unsafe secrets.</li>
    <p>Unsafe secrets are secrets that may put you or others at risk of getting hurt. </p>
    <p>Example of Unsafe Secrets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>if they involve unsafe touches</li>
      <li>if they involve someone else being harmed</li>
      <li>being forced to look at pictures or videos that make them feel uncomfortable</li>
      <li>being asked to undress</li>
      <li>being forced to drink or eat or sniff something</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure your child truly understands the difference. Provide them with scenarios of safe and unsafe secrets and let them tell you what they are.</p>
    <li>Help your child choose 3 to 5 trusted or safe adults (you included).</li>
    <p>Those are the people who they can go to if they feel unsafe. One must be present at school or childcare where the child spends his days and the others could be family members and friends. Make sure your child helps in choosing those people as they are the ones that need to feel completely comfortable and safe to approach those adults for help.</p>
    <p>Those safe adults need to show understanding, zero judgement and be proactive when it comes to what the child has said and not dismiss them in any way.</p>
    <li>Teach them and help them practice saying “NO, Stop It! I don’t like that!”</li>
    <p>These are not only words; you need to also teach them the posture that comes with it. Hands on hips, legs slightly apart, shoulders thrown back and head held high. This is a very empowering stance and should be practiced regularly and not only when facing molesters, but also with peers who are bullying. </p>
    <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY: it is never their fault, you will believe them no matter what.</li>
    <p>Assure them that they can come and talk to you about anything, not just through words, but also action. The phrase “You can tell me anything” loses its meaning if parents respond to questions or information from children with punishments, aggressive reactions, anger, or dismissiveness.</p>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Revisit this often. Children learn through repetition. This is not a “let’s sit down and talk this one time and be done with it” kind of matter. How many times do you remind children to look both ways before crossing the street, or to blow the hot food before eating?</p>
  <p>On a final note, here are some books that I recommend, or head to https://ranatayara.selz.com/pages/products and download our “I am the boss of my body” activity books (in English, Arabic or French).</p>

    content: `<p><b>The background (origins, personal story)</b></p>
    <p>Lydia María Cacho Rìbeiro was born in 1963 in Mexico City. She became a journalist at 23 years old, specializing in gender issues and human rights. She is a feminist and a human rights activist who has been keen on defending human rights from an early age. Thanks to her mother, who has been her source of inspiration, Lydia has dedicated her life to investigating and exposing human trafficking, sexual violence, organized crime, corruption, and impunity. Amnesty International described her as "perhaps Mexico's most famous investigative journalist and women's rights advocate." Cacho is the winner of numerous international awards for her journalism, including the Civil Courage Prize, the Wallenberg Medal, and the Olof Palme Prize. In 2010, she was named a World Press Freedom Hero of the International Press Institute. When describing her job, she said: "I believe the role of journalism is to be a lantern, allowing society to exercise its right to know and understand; I believe human rights are non-negotiable. As long as I live, I will continue to write, and writing will keep me alive."</p>
    <p><b>The barrier(s) that she is trying to address</b></p>
    <p>Lydia's work as a journalist and her activism as a citizen are intertwined. Through her investigative reporting, Lydia Cacho willingly exposes herself at risk to fight against discrimination, racism, and violence against women and girls by writing it. When trying to achieve human dignity and equality, Cacho's aspiration was full of challenges. Working as a female journalist in Mexico can be dangerous, and being a women's rights activist even more so. In 2005, she released her book "The Demons of Eden" on stories of girls' abuses and pornography in a Cancún beach resort, exposing high-profile politicians and influential businessmen. In her book, Lydia Cacho revealed how several powerful men had been involved in the pederast-pedophile network. She reported on the ties of businessman José Kamel Nacif Borge, El rey de la mezclilla, the "King of Denim," for his jeans’ factories, and Jean Succar Kuri, the owner of a hotel in Cancún who was to be charged with child pornography. Consequently, Lydia was accused of libel and defamation and got arrested by the police in Cancún. During her detention, Lydia suffered several waves of abuse by the public enforcement that she later reported. She has been kidnapped, raped, assaulted, and tortured for 20 hours. She also received 20 death threats over the phone if she did not stop reporting. Nevertheless, Cacho refused to be silenced, and, in 2006, she wrote on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. The injustices and abuses she suffered acted as a motivational strength to keep forward with her cause and defend her human rights, together with every other girl. In addition, in 2018, her documentary Somos valientes, “We are brave,” was released, which details the effect of violence on Mexican children. For two years, Lydia Cacho, the director of this docuseries, traveled with a team of documentary filmmakers and human rights experts to five different states in the country to talk and interview children about their rights. Afterward, in 2020, she was the host and executive producer of a bilingual podcast about femicide along the border in Ciudad Juárez through interviews with the investigators and the victims' families who tried to solve the crimes. The podcast was called "the Red Note" in English and "La Nota Roja" in Spanish.</p>
    <p><b>The impact on women's empowerment</b></p>
    <p>When Lydia Cacho realized how many women needed help and advice, she decided to start a support group. The support group later evolved into a maximum-security shelter for women and children; a formal institution called El Centro Integral de Atención a las Mujeres, in Cancun. El Centro is a non-profit organization funded by donations whose staff is composed of professionals in defense of victims. Thanks to her high-security shelter, Cacho provides a safe space for survivors of trafficking, domestic violence, and other forms of abuse and exploitation to access health, legal and other support services. El Centro helps the victim with legal assistance, and they take all the cases from the beginning to the end. The survivors can remain in the facility for one year to one year and a half to get the psychological treatment they deserve and protection from the predators. Further, the shelter has the objective to find a safe place for victims of abuse and takes the responsibility to train them to reintegrate into society with work skills to be independent and feel free again. The Cancun center for aid to women and their children has been recognized as one of the best aid centers in Mexico. Lydia’s mission through this shelter is to advocate for the endowment of women in health and education.</p>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>In conclusion, promoting gender equality and strengthening women's rights is essential for sustainable development. People like Lydia María Cacho Rìbeiro should serve as an example to overcome inequality. Her work and her bravery helped many girls to come forward and bring their oppressors to justice and take back control of their lives. She dedicated her years as an activist to the cause by deciding to denounce on paper the suffering of women, even if that required putting herself in danger. Through her book, she sent many criminals to prison and gave voice to many victims in different parts of the country. Additionally, after her detention following the publication of “The Demons of Eden,” journalism was decriminalized; hence, journalists could no longer be held accountable for defamation and libel. Her court case, together with the media reaction, and the intervention of political actors, initiated a process of change. Thanks to her book, also legislation concerning child pornography has evolved considerably. Particularly in a country like Mexico, which is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalism, the work of Lydia is essential. The prizes she was accredited with and the international visibility she received acted as a shield and provided her protection. To conclude, Lydia Cacho firmly believes in the importance of electronic media and its decisive role in accessing information. She criticizes media monopoly, one of the most significant problems in Mexico, and fight to keep community radio stations alive as they are vital for the freedom of information and to spread the news across the country.</p>`,

    content: `<p>"Tolerance is respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world's cultures, our forms of expression, and ways of being human." UNESCO's 1995 Declaration of Principles on Tolerance.</p>
    <p>In celebration of International Day of Tolerance, the #InHerShoes/#EnSusZapatos campaign will be sharing this space with our LGBTQAI+ community and their stories of what it means to come out in society. For those that haven’t had the chance to showcase their true essence, we see you and acknowledge the great bravery and courage that comes with accepting yourself fully.</p>
    <p>“Transgender people – and particularly Black and Latina transgender women – are marginalized, stigmatized and criminalized in our country.” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, deputy executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE). (Stories)</p>
    <p>In countries in Latin America, like Colombia, the life expectancy for a transgnder woman is estimated between 35 and 41 years old (read the article linked in our bio for more information!).  This is not good enough and we need to find solutions to eliminate all violence against all women and work to ensure transgender women, like all women, are also safe to live freely.</p>
    <p>Intersex persons (born with reproductive/sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit the standard of being a female/male) are vulnerable to abuse based on ignorance or bigotry about their bodies. Intersex victims of domestic violence face similar or higher rates when compared to the general population.</p>
    <p>The #InHerShoes/#EnSusZapatos campaign extends beyond cis-hetero women (born biologically in their gender/sex) and aims to spread awareness about violence against womxn+ domestically and globally. Womxn+ is an inclusive term that is used to address cis women, transgender and intersex women, non-binary people, and female-identified individuals. Join our fight for women’s rights and protections by participating in our actions! </p>

    bio: `Selene Caspani is Italian, passionate about art, nature, and space. She studied Biotechnology at the University of Milano-Bicocca, where she obtained her master’s on Science.

She loves solving puzzles and looking for those subtle and infinite interconnections in everything around her. She believes in free and creative education as ways to form thinking minds since it is essential to give children and young people new educational models to stimulate their curiosity and developing and supporting their natural inclinations.

Her aim is to support us by creating interesting and impactful content to spark the interest and curiosity of children and young adults.

    bio: `Troy’nia Douglas is a recent graduate with a BSc. in Psychology with a minor in Business from Nova Southeastern University. In the year 2020, she was given the opportunity to fulfill her passion supporting women’s rights by becoming a Women’s Rights Ambassador with Educación Diversa after organizing her own creative project during her summer 2020 internship with Freedom Speakers International (FSI)  based in Seoul, South Korea.  Nia created a virtual conference centered around spreading awareness about female North Korean refugees and fundraising for TNKR’s new program designed to provide refugee women with the opportunity to gain work experience, a stipend, and adequate health insurance. Since then, she has assisted the organization with doing research on a number of issues that are affecting women, children, and communities in different parts of the world. Because of this experience of doing research, she realized that this was something she thoroughly enjoyed doing because it gave her the opportunity to not only educate herself but also to share what she learned with everyone she comes into contact with. As a contributing writer, she plans to help to spread awareness through education, organize projects, and work with other strong, inspiring, and intelligent men and women to continue to raise awareness about human rights issues existing in today’s world.`
